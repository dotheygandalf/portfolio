# About Me

I am a front end engineer who loves to dig into the mindset of the user and fight for what they need.  Over the years, I have worn many hats and I have done everything from design, to product management, to backend engineering.  But at the end of the day, I love understanding workflows and building great user experiences that empower my customrs.


I am currently work at Slack <i class="fab fa-slack" aria-hidden="true"></i> on the Internal Tools team where I have built everything from bots to build and release tooling.

When I am not working, I am either reading, napping or catching up on my ever growing backlog of games.
