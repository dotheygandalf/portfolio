## My Role

Parasoft is a company known for its software testing tools: static analysis, unit testing, web functional testing, service virtualization. I joined Parasoft's Development Testing Platform team to help rethink aspects the Report Center, a product that aggregated all of the analysis our testing tools generated.

### New (UI/UX) Blood

The developer running the tool on her local machine may see the test results, but what about her manager?  Or even her manager's manager, the VP, the CEO?  Parasoft's Report Center was the key to aggregating all the data from all our tools.  It was my job to make sure that the user flows, the aesthetics, and the overall experience enabled our customers to gain insight into their codebase.

### Introducing Process

Being inquisitive during the design process, using personas to flesh out user stories, writing functional specs before starting on wireframes.

### Taking the initiative

As the only front end developer I had to try real hard to get people to understand the value of making things that are easy to use.

## Fighting For the User

### Not Their Choice

Companies were buying Parasoft software for their employees to use.  It was easy to make a product that was cool during demos, but when it comes down to it, I don't want to make a product that will be hated by its users.

### Bring Value

If the users are not the ones choosing to use this tool, then we have to make them believers.  No one wants to have something forced onto them. It is about bringing value to all levels of users.

### Call To Action

There is an overwhelming amount of data.  A tool has power when you enable a user to learn something that they did not know already.  A tool has ____ when you enable a user to solve the problem that is found.

## Choice

Parasoft's Report Center relied heavily on a navigation bar to get users from one report to another.  It's reports were complicated, contained very specific sets of data, and were often hard to find as you would need to know which category to look in and by what name this report was known as.  If you wanted something slightly different, well, you would have to put in a feature request for it.

### Data Wants to be Free

Let us not presume to know what the users want.  We are not the gatekeepers of their data.  Instead, we need to think about our product as a tool that allows users to focus.  We don't dictate what they focus on, but we allow them to have the freedom to explore the data.  Who knows what they will find.

## Rough Patches

Discovering what was the good part.  There was a certain getting distracted by the new and the shiny.  There was difficulty in getting across the core concepts.   Instead we were still making sacrifices to usability in ther name of short term goals.

### Names

When you attempt to name everything, you find out quickly that you have run out of names.  Instead of trying to name everything, make the visualization speak for itself.  Give the users enough visual cues so that they can read the data quickly from the context of their current environment.

### Standard Visualizations

Based on the work of Stephen Few's [Information Dashboard Design](http://www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-At-Glance/dp/1938377001/), we created a set of basic visualizations that would be able to present data in a consistent, coherent, and unassuming manner.

## In Retrospect

### Rewrites are hard

Inheriting a legacy product has its issues as further development either means keeping everything the same and making more of the same old thing, or tearing out certain parts in order to rethink certain paradigms.  Code rewrites are already a tricky business, but when the entire architecture from a concepts perspective needs to be rethought, it requires a lot of work.

### Reclaiming Zero

When we let users keep track of problem areas that they discover, we make zero worth something.  It means that their work is done.  It gives the users a sense of completion, a sense of satisfaction.
