## Overview

An experiment using GitHub's [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/){:target="_blank"} project to build a desktop application for Parasoft's Project Center.

## Problems

1. Unsorted things are hard to find
1. The product should push me towards keeping track of the work that I am doing.
1. If I am not doing any work, the product should suggest something for me to do or remind me to keep track of what I am doing.
1. I want tasks to be made as I fix the bugs that are kept in the bug tracking system.

## Goals

I aimed to simplify the workflow of Project Center to make it more developer driven.  Project Center is good for organizing tasks from a manager's perspective.

I also wanted a chance to explore building desktop apps using web technologies.  Using Electron was cool way to see how Google's V8 JavaScript engine was being used beyond the browser.

I also wanted to experiment with creating applications that were cross platform.
